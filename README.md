## How to Use

[Back to Top ^](#tasklist-app)

This app originally came without a tutorial. However, after some beta-testing, I decided to create a short interactive tutorial that teaches you how to use the app and all of its features.

Once the app is loaded, click on the ? icon in the upper right-hand corner to begin this tutorial.
